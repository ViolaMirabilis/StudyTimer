A WIP study timer to track hours spent crying while learning maths. I assume it might come in handy for people in the same boat.
Possible features:
* setting up a countdown of your choice of time
* playing ambient sounds to immerse and focus on a given task
* stopping, resuming and restarting the countdown
* timer break between focus sessions
* session log, where one can see how many times and for how long have they focused
